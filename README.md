Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.10 or higher)
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```

   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   
   Change your working directory to the project directory using the following command:

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   Install the required Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip. Run the following command:

   ```
4. **Set Up OpenAI API Key:**

   To utilize the OpenAI API within the application, ensure you have an OpenAI API key. Set your OpenAI API key as an environmental variable named OPENAI_API_KEY on your system. Replace sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your actual OpenAI API key.

   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   
   OR
   
   Create a .env file in the project directory if it doesn't exist already. Add the following line to the .env file, replacing sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your actual OpenAI API key:
   
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
